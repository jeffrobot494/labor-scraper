You are my coding assistant.

Write me a Python script that does the following:

Download the 2023 Form 5500 "small plan" dataset from the Department of Labor:
URL: https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ebsa/researchers/data/5500-data/2023/2023-sf.zip

Extract the CSV file inside the ZIP.

Load the CSV using pandas.

Find all rows where the sponsor name (field: SPONS_DFE_NAME) matches approximately "THE INTERSECT GROUP" using fuzzy matching (allowing slight misspellings or differences).

Print out for each match:

Sponsor Name

Filing ID (field: ACK_ID)

Plan Year (field: PLAN_YEAR)

Requirements:

Use requests to download the file.

Use zipfile to extract it.

Use pandas to load and process the CSV.

Use rapidfuzz or fuzzywuzzy to do fuzzy matching of names.

Handle large file sizes gracefully (use low_memory=False in pandas read_csv).

Please organize the code cleanly into functions:

download_file(url, output_path)

extract_zip(zip_path, extract_to_folder)

find_matching_rows(csv_path, target_name)

main()

Add simple print statements so I can see the script progress as it runs.
